msr-gen.pl will take doc/msr.txt as input and generate the files msr-def.h,
msr-decode.c, msr-def.fth, msr-decode.fth, and msr.fth.

Note that the contents of msr.txt comes from Oban Exception Model.  There are two blocks of contents:
     3.10.3 Instructions for Accessing Special Purpose Registers
and  3.10.8 Access mechanisms to System Registers

Cut and paste the text from the tables in those sections and put it into msr.txt and then:

1) Remove the page footer information.

2) There are regiseters with / in their names, our guess is that this means
   the registers have two names.  One with the text just before the / and
   the other with text just after the /.  E.g., SPSR_hyp/EL2 -> SPSR_HYP
   and SPSR_EL2.

3) Run ./msr-gen.pl and review the output.

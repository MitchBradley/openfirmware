<h2 align="center">Getting Started</h2>
<h3>Unpacking the Files</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Login to the Linux MIPS machine that you will use for your Open Firmware
compilations.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Create a directory on that machine for the Open Firmware build tree.
&nbsp;It can be on either a local disk or a mounted network filesystem. A
mounted filesystem may be better in the long run if you expect to use the
same tree for other processor architectures later. Example: &nbsp;<b>mkdir
/home/wmb/ofw</b></li>
  <li>Set the BP environment variable to that directory. Example: <b>export
BP=/home/wmb/ofw</b></li>
  <li>Enter that directory:<b> cd $BP</b></li>
  <li>Extract the files: <b>tar xf mips-ofw.tar.gz</b></li>
  <li>If you use &nbsp;CVS or a similar version control system, checkin the
tree.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Creating platform directories</h3>
Builds are done in a directory named $BP/cpu/mips/<i><b>chipset/platform</b></i>/build/
.<br>
<br>
<i><b>chipset </b></i>is a name that identifies the core logic chipset for
your system. &nbsp;Source files in that directory contain code that is common
to all systems built with that chipset. In some cases, the source distribution
will already include a suitable <i>chipset </i>directory for your chipset,
e.g. $BP/cpu/mips/emma2/.<br>
<ul>
  <li>If a suitable chipset directory does not exist, create one. Example:
    <b>mkdir $BP/arch/mips/mychip</b></li>
</ul>
<i><b>platform</b></i> is a name that you choose to identify your system.
You need a separate <i>platform</i> directory for each distinct Open Firmware
binary image. Typically you would have a different platform directory for
each of your different boards. Source files in that directory contain code
that is board-specific. For example, different boards often have different
external I/O devices, so the builder script files in the various <i>platform</i>
directories would load different I/O drivers. &nbsp;It is possible to support
several boards from a single Open Firmware binary image if the board differences
can be detected at run time. There is a tradeoff between the difficulty of
maintaining several different images versus the trouble of testing new combined
images on all platforms.
<ul>
  <li>Create one or more platform directories. &nbsp;Example: <b>mkdir $BP/cpu/mips/mychip/myboard</b>
  </li>
</ul>
The builder puts object files in a "build" subdirectory beneath the <i>platform</i>
directory. &nbsp;Typically the build directory contains no source files.<br>
<ul>
  <li>Create a build directory below each platform directory. Example: <b>mkdir
$BP/cpu/mips/mychip/myboard/build</b></li>
</ul>
<h3>Compilation tools</h3>
The Open Firmware compilation process uses the following tools:
<dl>
  <dd><b>build</b> is the main command for Open Firmware compilation. It
is a simple shell script that you install &nbsp;(per the above) in a directory
on your search path. The script's purpose is to set some environment variable
and then to locate and execute the appropriate executable files for the particular
host system.</dd>
  <dd><b>forth</b> is the executable program that <b>build </b>invokes. It
resides in $BP/bin/<i>cpu</i>/<i>os</i>/forth, where <i>cpu </i>and <i>os</i>
are the host instruction set (e.g. mips) and operating system (e.g. linux)
on which it executes.</dd>
  <dd><b>native.dic</b> is the Open Firmware compiler. It resides in $BP/bin/<i>cpu</i>/native.dic
. native.dic is a Forth dictionary file that includes all the tools necessary
for the compilation process, including a Forth metacompiler, a Forth incremental
compiler, an assembler, an FCode tokenizer, an FCode detokenizer, a dependency
manager (the "builder"), and a dropin manager (tools for creating sequences
of &nbsp;dropin modules to form a ROM image file). &nbsp;It can also be extended
with tools to create specific download file formats.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Compiling "forth" the first time</h3>
The <b>forth </b>executable is actually just a collection of I/O interface 
procedures that provide the "glue" to let native.dic work on a particular 
operating system. The forth executable is the only part of the system that 
must be compiled with external tools. It is written in C, and may be compiled 
by various C compilers; typically gcc on a Unix system (but it doesn't use 
any GCC-specific extensions). After it has been compiled once, it does not 
need to be compiled again unless you change the host operating system in a
way that breaks older binaries or shared libraries.<br>
<br>
To find out if you need to recompile the "forth" executable for your system,
do this (on the MIPS Linux development system):<br>
<blockquote>
  <pre>cd $BP/bin/mips/linux<br>./forth ../native.dic</pre>
</blockquote>
You should see a banner like this:<br>
<blockquote>
  <pre>Forthmacs version 4.0<br>Copyright (c) 1994 FirmWorks&nbsp; All Rights Reserved<br>ok <br></pre>
</blockquote>
To exit, type <b>bye</b> .<br>
<br>
If the above doesn't work, type:<br>
<blockquote>
  <pre>make forth</pre>
</blockquote>
and try again.

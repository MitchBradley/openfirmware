Open Firmware for Emulated MIPS PC
==================================

This builds an image that works with QEMU "mips" little-endian virtual
machine.

Note that it is actually not really useful for anything other than
checking that cpu/mips can still build a working firmware image.

The machine essentially consists of ye olde IBM PC peripherals attached
to a ISA bridge that routes memory accesses to 0x10000000 and I/O port
accesses to 0x14000000. The console muxes the serial port, i8082 keyboard
and VGA screen in text mode (the emulated graphics card is a very basic
VGA, framebuffer is not available).

Linux (as of 5.9) doesn't really support the machine mainly because drivers
for the original PC hardware are about the oldest ones and many don't bind
to device tree nodes. If you still want to try it, run:

  $ qemu-system-mips64el -cpu MIPS64R2-generic -M mips \
      -bios mipsel_bios.bin -serial stdio

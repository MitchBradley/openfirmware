<h1>Open Firmware Startup on MIPS Processors</h1>
 This document describes the startup process for Open Firmware on MIPS processors.
 It summarizes the requirements for MIPS startup and tells how Open Firmware
code modules can be structured to accomplish the system initialization necessary
for running the main Open Firmware Forth code. 
<h2>Overview of Open Firmware Structure</h2>
 The sizes listed below are for the code when it is resident in RAM. When
in ROM, the code is typically compressed (as with gzip) to about one half
its uncompressed size. 
<p> The Open Firmware ROM image consists of a sequence of modules in "dropin
format".  Each "dropin module" consists of a 32-byte header and some code
or data of varying length.  The details of dropin module format are described
in a later section.  The various dropin modules are concatenated to form
the overall ROM image. </p>
<p> The critical dropin modules are: </p>
<ul>
 <li>resetjmp - about 1K </li>
  <li>reset - about 3K </li>
  <li>start - variable; perhaps 3K to 25K </li>
  <li>firmware - about 400K </li>
</ul>
 
<h3>The "resetjmp" code</h3>
 On MIPS processors, the first instruction that is executed after the CPU
comes out of reset is at the beginning of the ROM, so the first thing in
the ROM cannot be a dropin module with a proper dropin header.  The first
true dropin module (with a header) is after the code that occupies the exception
vectors defined by the MIPS hardware specification. The code at the reset
vector jumps directly to the beginning of first true dropin module, named
"reset".<br>
<br>
The source file that defines this code is "arch/mips/<i>platform</i>/resetjmp.bth".
&nbsp;It may also contain entry code for the other ROM exception vectors.
  
<h3>The "reset" module</h3>
 The "reset" module is a relatively small (typically about 3K) amount of
machine code that sequences the execution of other dropin modules to accomplish
the early startup process.  In principle, the "reset" module ought to be
generic so that the same code could run on any MIPS system, but in practice 
it is somewhat platform specific for two reasons: 
<ol>
 <li>The reset code must flush the cache, and cache-flushing code varies
somewhat across different MIPS processors </li>
  <li>It's useful to include in the reset code some rudimentary debug facilities
like LED blinking or serial line output; such code is inherently platform-specific. 
  </li>
</ol>
Possibly after initializing a diagnostic output device, the reset module
locates the start module (by searching through the ROM to find a dropin module
with the named "start" in its header) and calls it (at its beginning address)
as a subroutine.<br>
<br>
The source file that defines this module is "arch/mips/<i>platform</i>/reset.bth".<br>
 
<h3>The "start" module</h3>
 The purpose of the start module is to initialize the core logic, memory
system, and just enough of the I/O system to get a diagnostic serial port
working.  The start module is entirely dependent on the design of the core
logic hardware, so it must be rewritten for each chip family. Writing and
debugging the start module is the crucial step in bringing up Open Firmware
on a new MIPS chipset. A later section of of this document tells how to create
a start module for a new chipset.  In preparation for initializing the memory
and a serial port, the start module often has to initialize other parts of 
the core logic such as caches, first-level host bridges, etc.  In general,
however, the "start" module initializes just enough to get a memory and serial
port working.  Initialization of secondary devices like interrupt and DMA
controllers, timers, and most I/O devices is usually left to later code in
the "firmware" module.<br>
<br>
The source file that defines this module is "arch/mips/<i>platform</i>/start.bth".
If the process of initializing the memory system is relatively simple, the
entire "start" code might be in that one file. Otherwise, "start.bth" might
sequence the compilation process of several other files that together implement
the core logic and memory system startup sequence.<br>
 
<h3>Loading the "firmware" module</h3>
 The start modules returns (as from a normal subroutine) to the reset module
that called it.  Subsequent code can then use the RAM memory that the start
module initialized.  The reset module's final task is to locate the "firmware"
module (by searching ROM for a dropin module named "firmware"), move it into
RAM, and jump to it.  However, there are some complications: 
<ul>
 <li>The "firmware" module is usually stored in ROM in compressed (gzip) form.
 If that is the case, the "reset" module must unzip the "firmware" module
into RAM instead of simply copying it.  To do so, the "reset" module locates
the "inflate" module, copies it into RAM (for faster execution), and calls
it with the ROM address of the compressed "firmware" module and the RAM address
where the uncompressed version should be placed. </li>
  <li>After the "firmware" module has been copied or uncompressed into RAM,
it is usually necessary to flush the data cache and invalidate the instruction
cache so the CPU can execute the firmware code. </li>
</ul>
 Even if the system has enough ROM to store the "firmware" module in ROM
uncompressed, there is an advantage to compressing it. The compressed image
contains a CRC and a redundant length; taken together they constitute a quick
and effective test of the integrity of ROM and RAM.  ROM problems corrupt
the compressed code stream, which makes the inflater get "out of sync" and
misread the final length field.  RAM problems show up as a CRC mismatch when
the inflater computes the CRC of the RAM image after uncompressing it. 
<p> It's possible to do more extensive memory tests at this point, but it's
better to defer them until later, when the full Open Firmware I/O system
can be used to report the results. </p>
<h3>The "firmware" module</h3>
 The firmware module contains the vast majority of the functionality of Open
Firmware.  It is mostly written in Forth, on top of a relatively small assembly
language kernel that implements the Forth virtual machine. Its basic internal
structure is that of a Forth "dictionary", which is a set of linked lists.
 Each such list is called a "vocabulary".  The list elements are called "words".
Each word has a name, an associated action, and optionally some data.  A
particular word's action can be implemented by either a sequence of machine
code or a sequence of other words.  Typically, only the most basic primitive
operations (add, subtract, branch, copy, etc.) are implemented as machine
code words. 
<p> The Forth dictionary is incrementally compiled in a layered fashion. Each
layer is internally complete and self-consistent as far as it goes. </p>
<h4>The C Wrapper</h4>
 The same Forth dictionary image can run either as a standalone program on 
the target machine (when it is fulfilling the functions of Open Firmware) 
or as a user program under Linux or another operating system.  In this latter
mode, it requires help from an external program that is called the "C wrapper".
 The "C wrapper" is an executable program that is compiled from C source
code.  Its job is to provide basic system services like I/O and memory allocation,
isolating the system-independent Forth dictionary from operating-system-specific
details such as the system's executable file format. 
<p> The compilation process for the Forth dictionary depends on this technique 
of running Forth as a user process.  A basic Forth system runs under Linux 
with the help of the C wrapper program, extends itself by compiling source
code from files, and saves the extended Forth dictionary into another file.
 The process can be repeated as necessary, until the resulting file contains
all the features that are needed for the Open Firmware system that is to
run on the target system.  It can then be embedded within the "firmware"
dropin module. </p>
<h4>The Forth Kernel - kernel.dic</h4>
 The innermost layer is the Forth language kernel.  It is a fully-functional 
implementation of the core ANS Forth language.  It contains an interactive 
interpreter and an incremental compiler, so it is capable of extending itself
by compiling new words into its dictionary. 
<p> The Forth kernel implementation contains MIPS machine code sequences,
so its binary image is specific to the MIPS-32 instruction set architecture. 
The kernel does not contain any code that is specific to particular MIPS processor
variants or to particular system architectures.  It uses only user-level
MIPs instructions. </p>
<p> The Forth kernel source code is very stable and almost never needs to
be changed in order to port Open Firmware to a new platform.  The only time 
the kernel source needs to change is to port Open Firmware to a new instruction
set architecture, and even then most of the kernel files remain unchanged. 
</p>
<p> The compilation directory for the Forth kernel is fm/cwrapper/mips/build. 
The command for compiling it is </p>
<pre>    build kernel<br></pre>
 In most cases, you won't need to execute this command explicitly, because 
higher-level builder scripts will do it automatically if necessary.  The name
of the kernel image file is "kernel.dic".  The builder script for compiling
it is "fm/cwrapper/mips/kernel.bth" . 
<h4>(The Metacompiler)</h4>
 The kernel is compiled from source code that is written in a combination 
of high-level Forth and assembly language.  The assembly language code uses
a simplified postfix syntax that is very easy to parse, so the assembler
is very simple and small.  The program that compiles the Forth kernel is
called a "metacompiler".  It processes source code that is very similar to
the source code accepted by an ordinary Forth incremental compiler, but the
metacompiler can do some extra things: 
<ul>
 <li>It can create a new self-contained Forth system that is separate from
itself, rather than just being able to add on to an existing Forth dictionary. 
  </li>
  <li>It can cross-compile a Forth kernel for an instruction set other than
the instruction set on which the metacompiler is running. </li>
  <li>It can handle forward references transparently. </li>
</ul>
 However, the metacompiler does have one important limitation - it cannot
handle arbitrary data constructs defined by means of CREATE and DOES&gt;
(these are advanced Forth features).  This limitation makes it difficult
to metacompile the entire Open Firmware system as one monolithic unit. 
<p> The metacompiler and the simple assembler are both included in the "builder"
program that is described later. </p>
<h4>Extended Forth - tools.dic</h4>
 The layer above the kernel is called "tools.dic", named for the file that
contains it.  Tools.dic is an extended Forth programming environment that
contains a number of useful tools such as an incremental assembler, a source-level
debugger, a callfinder, a wordfinder, a line editor with history and command
completion, and numerous other extensions that go beyond the basic words
defined by ANS Forth. 
<p> Tools.dic does not include any Open Firmware abstractions such as device
tree, packages, or FCode.  Those are in the next layer up. Tools.dic serves
as a common Forth language base for both the remainder of the Open Firmware
build process and also the builder program. </p>
<p> The compilation directory for tools.dic is fm/cwrapper/mips/build. The
command for compiling it is </p>
<pre>    build tools<br></pre>
 In most cases, you won't need to execute this command explicitly, because 
higher-level builder scripts will do it automatically if necessary.  The name
of the image file is "tools.dic".  The builder script for compiling it is
"fm/cwrapper/mips/tools.bth" . 
<h4>Base Firmware - basefw.dic</h4>
 The layer above tools.dic in the path to Open Firmware is "basefw.dic". Base
firmware contains the platform-independent parts of the features defined
by the Open Firmware standard, including the device tree, client interface,
FCode evaluator, and support packages.  It also includes numerous FirmWorks
extensions such as TCP and filesystem support. 
<p> basefw.dic does not contain any code that is specific to the board-level 
architecture or the devices that may be present on a particular platform. 
Thus the same basefw.dic binary image file can often be used unchanged as 
the basis for building platform-specific Open Firmware implementations for
multiple platforms that use the same CPU instruction set architecture (i.e.
MIPS in this case).  Porting to a new MIPS platform usually does not require
modifications to basefw.dic </p>
<p> Some code modules that are not platform-specific, and thus could be included 
in basefw.dic, are not included because the features that they implement are
optional.  The code itself is platform-independent, but the choice of whether
or not to include it is platform-specific. </p>
<p> The compilation directory for basefw.dic is fm/cwrapper/mips/build. The
command for compiling it is </p>
<pre>    build basefw<br></pre>
 In most cases, you won't need to execute this command explicitly, because 
higher-level builder scripts will do it automatically if necessary.  The name
of the image file is "basefw.dic".  The builder script for compiling it is
"fm/cwrapper/mips/basefw.bth" . 
<h4>The complete Open Firmware dictionary - fw.dic</h4>
 The final layer is "fw.dic".  It extends basefw.dic to include support for
a specific target hardware platform.  It includes device drivers for core 
devices like timers, interrupt controllers, bus bridges, diagnostic UARTs, 
FLASH chips, and NVRAM devices.  It also includes information describing the
physical address map and other system characteristics.  It may include diagnostics
for manufacturing, field service, and initial system checkout. Optional features
like support for specific program image formats (e.g. ELF) and file system
layouts (e.g. Linux ext2) are added at this level. Customer-specific code,
such as new user interface commands for special system maintenance requirements,
can be added as well. 
<p> "fw.dic", usually in compressed form, is the body of the "firmware" dropin 
module. </p>
<p> Drivers for PCI bus devices like mass-storage or network interfaces can
either be "hard-compiled" into fw.dic or attached externally as separate
dropin modules in FCode format.  The latter is often more convenient for
devices that are not needed during the early phases of platform initialization. 
</p>
<p> Most of the porting work for a new platform, apart from the very low
level code in the "start" module as described above, is done at the fw.dic
level. </p>
<p> Even though it contains a great deal of code that is specific to the
target hardware, it is still possible to run "fw.dic" under the compilation 
operating system via the C wrapper.  "fw.dic" contains separate entry points
and initialization sequences for the two environments (standalone execution
on the target system and OS-hosted execution on the compilation system).
The code that accesses target-specific devices is executed only if "fw.dic"
is entered via its standalone entry point. </p>
<p> This ability to run "fw.dic" in the OS environment can be quite convenient 
for debugging purposes, because you can use the built-in debugging facilities
to inspect the code that has actually been compiled.  It eliminates the need
for listings of the compiled code or "dump" files. </p>
<p> The compilation directory for basefw.dic is arch/mips/<i>platform</i>/build, 
where <i>platform</i> is the name of a directory for a specific target hardware
platform.  The command for compiling it is </p>
<pre>    build fw<br></pre>
 In most cases, you won't need to execute this command explicitly, because 
the top-level builder script will do it automatically if necessary.  The name
of the image file is "fw.dic".  The builder script for compiling it is "arch/mips/<i>platform</i>/fw.bth"
. 
<h4>The top-level builder script - rom.bth</h4>
 The file that contains the overall image of the entire contents of ROM (i.e.
FLASH) is "rom.img".  "rom.img" contains a sequence of dropin modules, including
"resetjmp", "reset", "start", "inflate", "firmware", and usually several
other modules containing things like FCode drivers for PCI devices. 
<p> The compilation directory for rom.img is arch/mips/<i>platform</i>/build, 
where <i>platform</i> is the name of a directory for a specific target hardware
platform.  The command for compiling it is </p>
<pre>    build rom<br></pre>
 <b><i>This is the top-level command that you use to recompile Open Firmware.</i></b> 
The name of the image file is "rom.img".  The builder script for compiling
it is "arch/mips/<i>platform</i>/rom.bth" . 
<h3>How MIPS Processors Come Out of Reset</h3>
 After reset, MIPS processors begin execution at the beginning of ROM at
virtual address 0xbfc00000. That virtual address corresponds to the physical
address 0x1fc00000.  The virtual-to-physical translation results from the
"kseg1" translation region, which maps virtual addresses 0xa0000000-0xbfffffff
to physical addresses 0x0000000-0x1fffffff in uncached mode.  Within that
physical address range, the first half (0x00000000-0x0fffffff) is usually
for RAM while the second half (0x10000000-0x1fffffff) is for I/O devices. 
<p> Early startup code typically runs from this uncached virtual address range
until the caches and the memory have been initialized. Thereafter, for faster
execution, code can be copied into memory where it can execute from the cached
"kseg0" translation region, which maps the same physical address range to
the virtual address range from 0x80000000-0x9fffffff.  When running from
kseg0, I/O accesses are still done through the kseg1 addresses, as it is
rarely correct to cache I/O registers.  (In some systems, the hardware permits
the execution of ROM code in cached mode; on those systems, you can run from
the kseg0 region before initializing memory.) </p>
<p> The code at the reset vector must jump to some other location within a
few instructions, because the other exception vectors are located at nearby
addresses.  The details vary somewhat across different MIPS processors, but
as a general rule the first 32 instruction locations are always available
for the reset code.  The top end of the ROM exception vector area is typically
at offset 0x3ff from the beginning of ROM, so the code in the first 32 instructions
typically jumps to other code at offset 0x400 or above. </p>
<h3>The Builder</h3>
 The FirmWorks "builder" program is an integrated tool for managing the Open
Firmware compilation process.  It has these features: 
<ul>
 <li>Dependency manager (similar in spirit to Unix "make") that 
    <ul>
 <li>Recompiles only those layers whose source has changed </li>
      <li>Automatically generates dependency lists during compilation </li>
      <li>Tracks the files used to help with release engineering tasks </li>
    </ul>
 </li>
  <li>Native and/or cross assemblers </li>
  <li>Metacompiler for cross-compiling Forth kernels </li>
  <li>Dropin module creation and inspection tools </li>
  <li>FCode tokenizer </li>
  <li>FCode detokenizer </li>
  <li>General-purpose Forth interpreter/compiler/environment </li>
</ul>
 
<h4>Builder scripts - .bth files</h4>
 Builder scripts look very similar to Forth source code, because the builder
is just a Forth compiler with the extensions listed above. It is possible
to convert an ordinary Forth source file into a builder script simply by
adding two lines near the beginning of the file. 
<p> Builder scripts have the filename extension ".bth", which makes it possible
for the builder to locate them automatically.  Ordinary Forth source code
files have the extension ".fth".  The wildcard pattern "*th" matches both
Forth source files and builder scripts, which is often convenient when using
"grep" to search for a particular string. </p>
<p> Each ".bth" file pertains to a single object file (in contrast to a Makefile,
which can list numerous "targets" in a single file). There can be (and usually
are) several ".bth" files in one directory, each pertaining to one target
object.  The base name of the ".bth" file is the same as the base name of
the target object; for example, if the target image filename is "rom.img",
the builder script filename is "rom.bth". </p>
<p> The ".bth" file need not be in the directory where the target will be
built; when the builder needs to recompile a target object, it will search
upward from the build directory until it finds an appropriately-named ".bth"
file.  The main purpose of this is to segregate source files and object files
in different directories. The "keep searching upwards" rule can be used to
good effect by having a generic ".bth" file in a higher level directory (e.g.
at the "/mips" level, but specific platforms that need something other than 
the default can override it by making their own version at a lower directory
level.</p>
<h4>Builder dependency lines</h4>
<h4> </h4>
<p> The only structural difference between a builder script and an ordinary 
Forth source code file is the addition of a few dependency lines near the
beginning of the file.  Those dependency lines give the builder information
like: </p>
<ul>
 <li>Which Forth dictionary file serves as the base for the next phase of
compilation. </li>
  <li>Which instruction set architecture is required for compilation </li>
  <li>Which input files, other than Forth source code files, the script depends
on. (The builder can automatically determine dependencies on Forth source
code files.) </li>
</ul>
 For example, here are the dependency lines at the beginning of fw.bth. 
<pre>dictionary: ${BP}/cpu/mips/build/basefw.dic<br>command: &amp;mipsfth &amp;dictionary &amp;this<br>build-now<br></pre>
 The "dictionary:" line says an up-to-date version of the  dictionary file
"${BP}/fm/cwrapper/mips/build/basefw.dic" is needed in order to perform the
compilation that is defined by the rest of this builder script.  If that
dictionary file is missing or out-of-date with respect to a files it depends
on, the builder will automatically build it first.  "${BP}" is a C wrapper
macro that expands to the base directory of the firmware source tree.  The
C wrapper automatically locates that base directory by searching up the tree 
from the current build directory. 
<p> The "command:" line tells which operating system command to use to recompile
the object that this builder script pertains to.  In general, it can be any
shell command, but it is often of the form shown. "&amp;mipsfth" is a builder
macro that expands to the name of the C wrapper program that is appropriate
for compiling MIPS code.  "&amp;dictionary" expands to the file named on
the preceding "dictionary:" line, and "&amp;this" expands to the name fo
the current builder script file.  If the object to be compiled is out of
date with respect to a dependency, that command line (after macro expansion)
is executed.  In this case, the MIPS C wrapper executable program would be
run, passing to it as command line arguments the name of the base dictionary
file and the name of the builder script file. </p>
<p> "build-now" tells the builder that there are no more dependency lines; 
it causes the builder to proceed to check the dependencies and to perform
any necessary recompillatin. </p>
<p> The normal Forth compiler treats builder dependency lines as comments. 
The rest of a builder script after the builder lines file contains the Forth
source code to be compiled.  Often that source code consists primarily of
"fload <i>filename</i>" commands, so the script mostly sequences the compilation
of other (ordinary) Forth srouce code files. However, that is just a weak
convention; builder scripts can and do contain arbitrary Forth code after
the builder command lines. </p>
<p> The only other type of dependency line that is typically used is "in:
<i>filename</i>".  That line, of which there can be many instances, tells
the builder that the object to be compiled has a dependency on the indicated
file.  "in:" lines are only necessary for files that are not Forth source
files.  Typically they are used for binary images like pretokenized FCode
binary files, prebuilt dropin modules, or object files compiled by other
language processors. </p>
<h4>Builder .log files</h4>
 When the Forth compiler writes out a file (typically a ".dic" dictionary
file), it also writes out a ".log" file with the same base name.  That ".log"
file lists the names and timestamps of all the files that were opened during
the compilation. (This logging functionality is actually implemented by the
C wrapper program.)  The builder uses the .log files to check dependencies. 
This is how the dependencies are maintained automatically. 
<p> The log files can be deleted at any time without losing any critical
information.  If a log file is missing, the builder won't try to avoid an
unnecessary recompilation by checking direct dependencies; it will just recompile
the target anyway.  It will, however, first recursively check dependencies
listed on "dictionary:" and "in:" lines, recompiling them first if necessary. 
</p>
<h4>The "build" command</h4>
 The "build" command invokes the builder.  "build" itself is a shell script
whose main function is to locate the correct C wrapper file and builder dictionary
("native.dic") for the OS and instruction set of the compilation host machine.
 The builder dictionary files are located in "bin/<i>CPU</i>/native.dic",
where <i>CPU</i> is the name of the instruction set that the builder dictionary 
runs on.  The C wrapper executable files are in "bin/<i>CPU</i>/<i>os</i>/forth",
where <i>os</i> is an operating system name like "linux".  The "build" shell
script works out the correct values for <i>CPU</i> and <i>os</i> and sets
the HOSTDIR environment variable to <i>path</i>/bin/<i>CPU</i>/<i>os</i>,
where <i>path</i> is the path to the root of the Open Firmware source tree.
 Then it runs the appropriate C wrapper ("forth") with the appropriate build
dictionary file ("native.dic"), like this: 
<pre>   ${HOSTDIR}/forth ${HOSTDIR}/../native.dic <i>arg</i>
</pre>
 <i>arg</i> is the argument that was on the "build" command line. It is the
name of the top-level target object that is to be compiled. The extension
can be present or absent; "build rom" and "build rom.img" are equivalent. 
<p> If <i>arg</i> is omitted, the builder will run in interactive mode, giving
you an "ok" prompt from which you can issue Forth commands to invoke any
of the other builder features.  Or you can just use it as a Forth interpreter. 
</p>
<h3>Language Alternatives for the Start Module</h3>
  Since its job is to configure and initialize the memory controller, the
"start" module can be written in any language that can generate code that
doesn't need RAM memory.  The pros and cons of several language choices are
given below. 
<h4>Forth</h4>
 Forth code requires a stack to operate, so it's not a viable candidate for
coding the "start" module. 
<h4>C</h4>
 With a lot of care, it's possible to write C code that doesn't need memory.
 You have to use exactly the right compiler flags, limit the number of variables
and the nesting depth of subroutine calls, and make sure the variables are
allocated to registers. Even then you often have to edit the assembly language
output to remove the stack preamble code at the top level. If you switch
to a new version of the compiler toolchain, you often have to go back and
change something to keep a memory dependency from creeping in.&nbsp; 
<p> Another technique is to use the cache, without memory backing, as variable
storage and stack for the C code.  That, too, requires some trickery, mastery
of the compiler switches, and usually some in-line assembly code.  But it
can be worthwhile if the memory controller is so complicated that programming
it in assembly language is just too difficult. </p>
<h4>Forth Assembler</h4>
 The FirmWorks builder program includes a
<a href=assembler.html>MIPS assembler</a>.
The syntax is unconventional
(it is postfix, so the operands are mentioned before the operands),
but the assembler is small and predictable. You can easily make macros
so you don't have to write out canned sequences explicitly every time.
The assembler also has built-in structured conditional macros that mimic
Forth control flow constructs ( e.g. ... IF ... ELSE ... THEN), so you
don't have explictly write branch instructions and keep track of labels.
<p> The Forth assembler is missing some of the more esoteric new MIPS
instructions, but it's relatively easy to extend it, or you can just insert
the opcode in the code as a hex number.
The assembler won't reorder code, so you have to be careful
with MIPS delayed branches. </p>
<p> The assembler is well integrated with the builder facilities for
creating dropin modules, so it's easy to package the resulting binary code
in the dropin module format. </p>
<h4>GNU Assembler</h4>
 The GNU assembler can generate arbitrary machine code sequences as needed.
 You can assemble the code into an ELF file, extract just the code into an
raw image file, then use the builder to encapsulate that raw image into a
dropin module.  The disadvantage of this approach is the need to maintain
an installation of the GNU toolchain in conjunction with the Open Firmware
build environment (many organizations will be using the GNU toolchain anyway,
so this may not be a severe disadvantage). One advantage is that many people
are already familiar with the GNU assembler.

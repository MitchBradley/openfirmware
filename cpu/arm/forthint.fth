\ The interrupt save/stack area is laid out as follows:
\ 0000   - register save area  (size h#44)
\ 0044   - data stack area     (size h#1100-h#44)
\ 1100   - return stack area   (size h#200)
\ 1300   - <end>
\
\ The register save area, which is exported to the client program via the
\ "tick" callback, contains the following registers, all from the interrupted
\ context:
\ 00  - psr
\ 04  - r0
\ 08  - r1
\ ...
\ 38  - r13 (sp)
\ 3c  - r14 (lr)
\ 40  - r15 (pc)
\
\ When the interrupt handler returns, the complete context is restored from
\ the save area.  The client program can cause a context switch by modifying
\ these saved valued.

   \ At the first indication of a keyboard abort, we branch to the
   \ Forth entry trap handler.  We do the actual branch after we have
   \ restored all the state, so it appears as if Forth were entered
   \ directly from the program that was running, rather than through
   \ the interrupt handler.

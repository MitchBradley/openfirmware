purpose: Low-level I/O interface for use with a C "wrapper" program.
\ See license at end of file

\ The C program provides the Forth kernel with an array of entry-points
\ into C subroutines for performing the actual system calls.
\ This scheme should be reasonably compatible with nearly any Unix
\ implementation.  The only difference would be in the implementation of
\ "syscall", which has to look up the address of the actual system call
\ C routine in the system call table provided to it by the C program loader.
\ It then has to convert the stack arguments into the same form as is
\ expected by the C system call routines.  This obviously depends on the
\ details of the C calling sequence, but should not be too hard because
\ C compilers usually pass arguments on the stack.
\    Syscall is defined in the kernel, because it is needed for basics like
\ key and emit.

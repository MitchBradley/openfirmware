\ The relocation map has one bit for every 32-bit word, since we assume
\ that relocated longwords must start on a 32-bit boundary

\ If the address is within the new part of the dictionary (between
\ relocation-base  and  relocation-base + max-image), set the corresponding
\ bit in relocation-map.  If the address is within the user area,
\ (between  up@  and  up@ + #user), set the corresponding bit in
\ user-relocation-map

\ This has to be deferred so it can be turned off until the relocation
\ table has been initialized.

== Booting OFW from BIOS via a USB Drive ==

You need a USB drive (hard disk, FLASH stick, pendrive) that is formatted with a FAT filesystem
(they come that way from the factory).

These instructions assume that you know the basics of mounting USB drives and copying files to and from them.

=== Build OFW ===

On a Linux system with gcc and Subversion installed:

  $ svn co svn://openbios.org/openfirmware
  $ cd openfirmware/cpu/x86/pc/biosload
  $ cp config-usbkey.fth config.fth
  $ cd build
  $ make

The output file is ofw.c32 .  It is in "COM32" format, as used by SYSLINUX.

* Copy ofw.c32 to the USB drive's root directory

* Copy openfirmware/cpu/x86/biosload/syslinux.cfg to the USB drive's root directory

=== Make the USB Key Bootable ... ===

==== ... On Linux ====

* Install the "syslinux" package (e.g. "apt-get install syslinux" or "yum install syslinux" or get the whole distribution from http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/boot/syslinux/ and use linux/syslinux therein).

* Unmount any filesystems that are currently mounted on the USB drive

* Find the USB drive's device name.  It will probably be something like /dev/sda .  You want the name of the whole drive (just sda), NOT a subordinate partition (NOT sda1).

* Run this command, replacing "/dev/sda" with the appropriate device name for your USB drive:

   $ syslinux /dev/sda


==== ... On Windows ====

* Open My Computer and find the drive corresponding to the USB key.  The following instructions assume that it is "F".

* Download and extract the following onto your host machine: http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/boot/syslinux/syslinux-3.72.zip

* Open a cmd window

* cd to the directory where you unzipped the syslinux files

* cd to the win32 subdirectory

* Run this command line, replacing "f" with the drive letter for your USB key:

      syslinux f:

* Use the "Safely Remove Hardware" icon in the system tray to stop the USB key device, then remove that device

=== Setup Your BIOS to Boot From USB ===

... depends on your particular BIOS, but in general, you must set the
boot order so something like "USB HDD" is the first choice.  You do not
want "USB ZIP drive" or "USB floppy".

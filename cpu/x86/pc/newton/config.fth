\ In virtual mode, OFW runs with the MMU on.  The advantages are
\ that OFW can automatically locate itself out of the way, at the
\ top of physical memory, it can dynamically allocate exactly as
\ much physical memory as it needs, and it can remain alive after
\ the OS starts.  The disadvantage is that it is more confusing -
\ you always have to be aware of the distinction between virtual
\ and physical addresses.

\ If you use virtual mode for Linux, you can debug past
\ the point where Linux starts using the MMU.  It is not strictly
\ necessary to use virtual mode if you just want to boot Linux
\ and then have OFW disappear.

purpose: Reprogram SPI FLASH from another XO-1.5

\ Use a working OLPC XO-1.5 board to recover one whose firmware is bad,
\ using a 6-pin ribbon cable connected from J3 on the good machine to J2
\ on the bad one.
\
\ The commands are:
\    ok clone                   \ Copies this machine's FLASH to the dead one
\    ok recover disk:\file.rom  \ Copies a ROM file to the dead one
\    ok excavate disk:\the.rom  \ Reads the dead ROM and writes to a file

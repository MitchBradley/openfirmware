\ The disadvantage of the timestamp counter is that it changes speed with
\ CPU throttling.  The advantage is that it is 64 bits, so no rollover.
create use-timestamp-counter \ Use CPU's timestamp counter for "ms"
\ create use-tsc-timing        \ Use timestamp counter for t( .. )t

\ The advantage of the ACPI counter is that its speed is independent of
\ CPU throttling.  The disadvantage is that it is 32 bits, so it rolls
\ over every 20 minutes or so, unless you extend it with an SMI handler.

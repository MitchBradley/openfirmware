A keyjector is an intermediate firmware release that installs
additional customer-specific security keys in manufacturing data.
OLPC signs it so it can be auto-reflashed.  When it starts, it inserts
the new keys, then replaces itself with a higher-rev firmware version
so it doesn't run again.

The version number for the keyjector is between two "real" releases.
It has to be higher than any version number that might already exist
on the customer's target machines.  For example, if the customer has
only q2e34 and earlier, the keyjector version might be q2e34x, and the
successor firmware might be q2e35.  In the worst case, this means that
you would have to make a new real firmware release so there is a
successor (q2e35 in this example).

The keyjector itself is built with an abbreviated release procedure,
within the existing build tree for the release right before the
successor.  In the example, the keyjector would be build in the
existing tree for q2e34.

The steps are:

* Unpack the tar file containing the new keys into, for example, /home/wmb/Uruguay

* Note the list of key names, e.g. d0 a1 o1 s1 t1 w1

$ cd /home/firmware/q2e34/openfirmware/cpu/x86/pc/olpc/build

* Edit ../keyjector.bth :

** Change the "macro: FW_MINOR " line to the keyjector's intermediate version number, e.g. 34x
** Changing lines like below to the right file and key names.
     " /space/bios-crypto/build/k2.public"         " s1"              $add-dropin

* Edit ../keyjector.fth :

** In wrong-sku?, set the list of SKUs.  This guards against "hijacking" of other country's laptops.
** In keyject-expired?, set an appropriate expiration date for the keyjector.
** In new-key-list$, set the key list.

$ ./build keyject

It should build really quickly, because it is using nearly all the same modules as the base build.

* Verify the version number in the new file:

** $ xxd q2e34x.rom | tail -4

* If you have to make a new "real" release so the keyjector has a successor, do so now.

* Sign the keyjector, naming the .zip file "bootfw.zip".

* Sign the successor firmware, name the .zip file "bootfw2.zip"

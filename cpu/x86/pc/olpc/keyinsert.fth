purpose: Inject additional keys into manufacturing data on non-secured machine
\ See license at end of file

\ This key insertion program is for use in manufacturing before the machines
\ have been secured, i.e. before the wp tag is created.

\ Search for !!! for things that may need to change for different deployments

\ !!! Change the list of SKUs according to which ones should receive the new keys

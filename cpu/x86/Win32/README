This is the build directory for Forth running under Windows.

If you are building one of the OFW versions from, say,
cpu/x86/pc/emu/build/Makefile, using MINGW32, you will need to create
a symlink to this directory whose name matches the output of uname.

For example (from our parent directory, i.e. cpu/x86):

$ uname
MINGW32_NT-6.1
$ ln -s Win32 MINGW32_NT-6.1

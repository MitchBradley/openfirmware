   \ Heres the trick, the reg property for the hierarchical IDE driver
   \ is set to either 0 or 1 indicating priamry or secondary IDE. We have
   \ to translate into the number that the driver up above needs to see
   \ according to the following table:
   \
   \  Device              Reg property       Address Parent Needs
   \    Primary Master         0                      0
   \    Primary Slave          1                      1
   \    Secondary Master       0                      2
   \    Secondary Slave        1                      3
   \
   \ So we look to see if we are passing up for the secondary bus, if
   \ we are, we just add 2 to the address.

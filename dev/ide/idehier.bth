purpose: Load file for IDE driver FCode

\ This version of the load file uses the following configuration:
\   IDE controller on PCI bus
\   Supports 4 drives (primary/secondary * master/slave)
\   IDE controller accessed via dynamically-assigned PCI addresses
\   DMA support present and enabled
\   Two-level hierarchy, i.e. pci-ide/ide@1/disk@1
\ This is the version that works with MacOS

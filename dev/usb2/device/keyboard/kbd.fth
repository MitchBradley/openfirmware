\ Scan code queue: raw data from USB keyboard (see later comment on entry detail)
\ 
\ q is a circular queue:
\    head is index to the start of queue to deque
\    tail is index to the last entry enqued
\
\ Each entry is a tuple of (mm xx kc kc kc kc kc kc)
\ where mm is modifier (bit mask of the gui, alt, shift, ctrl keys)
\       xx is don't care
\       kc are the raw scan codes, 0 meaning null
\
\ A new-entry is enqued iff the last-entry is not the same as the new-entry
\ to avoid duplicate entries.  This is an effort not to duplicate raw data
\ from the keyboard.
\
\ Except where BREAK is concerned, the get-scan code does not really interpret
\ the content of the raw data.

            \ of deque? is bad, because it leaves the lock set and potentially
            \ leaves the queue pointers and/or stateful hardware in an
            \ inconsistent state.  One solution would be to avoid calling
            \ deque after calling user-abort, but that would hang the driver
            \ if the alarm tick is turned off.

\ Process entries in the scan code queue.
\
\ For simplicity, the following process usesa key-state buffer which
\ is indexed by kc.  Each kc has a byte stating its state.  The states
\ are:
\   00 not pressed at all
\   01 currently pressed
\   -1 previously pressed
\
\ For each raw data entry from q,
\    scan key-state: 
\       for each kc,     if key-state[kc]==01, set to -1     \ make current previous
\                   else if key-state[kc]==-1, set to 0      \ make old previous null
\    scan raw data entry:
\       for each kc found, if key-state[kc]==0, process kc   \ queue if ascii
\                          key-state[kc]=1                   \ mark it currently pressed
\
\ There's plenty of room of performance/space fine tuning.

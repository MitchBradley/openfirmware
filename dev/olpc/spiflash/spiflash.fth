purpose: Driver for the SPI FLASH connected through the EC chip

\ Programming interface for SPI FLASH chips

\ This module is based on information from the datasheets of SPI FLASH chips,
\ and is ignorant of the details of host hardware.
\ It uses the following externally supplied routines to drive the host hardware.

\   spi-cs-on   ( -- )  Starts an SPI transaction by asserting CS#
\   spi-cs-off  ( -- )  Ends an SPI transaction by deasserting CS#
\   spi-out   ( b -- )  Sends a byte on the SPI bus
\   spi-in    ( -- b )  Receives a byte from the SPI bus
\
\   spi-us   ( -- us )  Approximate time in uS to do an spi-out
\     This lets us optimize the SST chip's auto-increment write
\     sequence by avoiding unnecessary polls of the status register.
\     If the host SPI access mechanism is so slow that the write
\     is guaranteed to have finished, polling is superfluous.

\ At the bottom of this file, there is a list of supported SPI FLASH
\ chips and the commands that they implement.


h# 10000 constant /spi-eblock   \ Smallest erase block common to all chips
h#   100 constant /spi-page     \ Largest write for page-oriented chips

\ Every SPI transaction starts with the assertion CS followed by a command code

: spi-cmd  ( cmd -- )  spi-cs-on  spi-out  ;

\ For some commands, a 3-byte address follows the command code

: spi-adr  ( adr -- )
   lbsplit drop  spi-out  spi-out  spi-out
;

\ The SPI status register tells you when a write is done
\ Its bitmasks are:
\  01 - RO  BUSY (Write in progress)
\  02 - RO  Write enable latch
\  04 - RW  Block protect 0 (non volatile on some parts)
\  08 - RW  Block protect 1 (non volatile on some parts)
\  10 - RW  Block protect 2 (non volatile on some parts)
\  20 - RW  SST BP3 - not used on other parts
\  40 - R   SST: Auto-Address Increment in progress (not used on other parts)
\  80 - RW  Status register write disable (write once)

: spi-read-status  ( -- b )  5 spi-cmd  spi-in  spi-cs-off  ; \ READSTATUS

\ I'm not sure this delay is necessary, but the EnE code did it, so
\ I'm being safe.  The EnE code did 4 PCI reads of the base address
\ which should be around 800nS.  2 uS should cover it in case I'm wrong
: short-delay  ( -- )  2 us  ;

\ You have to write-enable before any command that modifes stuff
\ inside the part - writes, erases, status register writes
\ The write-enabled mode is mostly self-clearing; the exception
\ is the SST part's auto-increment-address write sequence

: spi-write-enable  ( -- )  6 spi-cmd  spi-cs-off  short-delay  ;
: spi-write-disable  ( -- ) 4 spi-cmd  spi-cs-off  short-delay  ;

\ You have to wait after any command that modifies stuff
\ inside the part - writes, erases, status register writes

: wait-write-done  ( -- )
   \ The Spansion part's datasheet claims that the only operation
   \ that takes longer than 500mS is bulk erase and we don't ever
   \ want to use that command

\ This version is for SST parts, which use an auto-increment

\   ADcmd data0 data1  WAIT
\   ADcmd data0 data1  WAIT
\   ...
\   write-disable
\
\ WAIT can be any of:
\   a) Wait at least 10 uS
\   b) Poll the chip status register for the BUSY bit to clear
\   c) Hardware handshaking using the SO line (prior setup with cmd70)

\ Estimated programming time in the serial case:
\ 3 SPI bytes = 6 serial bytes per 2 programmed bytes, so 3 serial/programmed
\ 115200 is about 10,000 serial/second, so about 3K programmed/second.
\ About 5 minutes for 1 MiB, half that for a 512K load.

wrsr takes 5-15 ms
page program takes typ 1.4 max 5 ms
byte program takes typ 0.4 ms + Nx4us  max 5 ms
block erase takes typ 1s max 3s
bulk erase takes typ 10s max 20s
block is 64K
BP2-0 are non-volatile

Spansion:

jedec ID is 1 2 13
0xAB signature is 13
can program an entire page with cmd 2 by driving additional bytes
Spansion returns 0 0 for read ID, 
page program takes typ 1.5ms max 3ms

Winbond/NexFLASH:

0xAB signature is 13
http://www.winbond-usa.com/products/Nexflash/pdfs/datasheets/W25X10-20-40-80.pdf
page program takes typ 1.5ms max 5ms
byte program takes typ ???
4k erase takes typ 150ms max 300ms
block erase takes typ 1s max 2s
bulk erase takes typ 10s max 20s
also has 4K chunks
block is 64K
BP2-0 are non-volatile
BP3 is top/bottom protect


Identification:
 AB start-cmd 0 do-cmd read1 end-cmd
   If the result is 13, its either spansion or st
   If the result is BF, its SST

If spansion or st, do
 9f start-cmd read1 read1 read1 end-cmd
   spansion returns 1 2 13
   st returns 0 0 0 I think
 But I'm not sure it matters because they are pretty compatible

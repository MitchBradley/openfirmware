purpose: Capture ethernet packets into PCAP-format trace files
\ PCAP is the file format used by tcpdump and wireshark etc.
\ Spec: http://wiki.wireshark.org/Development/LibpcapFileFormat

\ NOTE: This program does not economise on calls to fputs. should it?

headerless

0 value capture-file
d# 64 value capture-length
0 value #captured

\ Write n-byte integers in host byte order. there's probably a simpler way..

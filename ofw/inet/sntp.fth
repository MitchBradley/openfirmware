\ vvv is version number
\ mmm is mode
\ TTTTTTTT is Reference Clock Type
\  0 means stop asking me
\  1 means primary reference (e.g. radio clock)
\  2 means secondary reference using NTP
\  3 means secondary reference using some other protocol
\  4 means wristwatch
\ pppppppp is Poll
\ PPPPPPPP is precision - signed integer exponent of 2

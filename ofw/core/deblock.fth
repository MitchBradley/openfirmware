purpose: Convert byte-oriented storage access to block-oriented ones
copyright: Copyright 1990-1994 Sun Microsystems, Inc.  All Rights Reserved

\ Block-to-byte conversion package using the Forth file system code to
\ do the deblocking.  Creates a file type which accesses the underlying
\ block device and opens a file descriptor for a file of that type.
\ The file descriptor is stored in the "my-data" field of the instance
\ record.  The "fid" field of file descriptor contains the address of
\ the private data for this device instance.

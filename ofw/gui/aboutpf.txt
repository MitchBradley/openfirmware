			About Power Firmware(TM)

Power Firmware is FirmWorks' implementation of Open Firmware which runs on
many processors including: PowerPC, X86, SPARC, StrongARM, MIPS and Alpha.

Open Firmware, defined by IEEE Standard 1275-1994, is a processor-independent
open standard for boot firmware.  It includes powerful capabilities for
processor-independent and operating-system-independent booting, auto-
configuration, testing, and debugging.

FirmWorks' "Power Firmware" implementation is based on field-proven code that
has been in service for many years, on over a million computer systems.

This demonstration version of Power Firmware is licensed for evaluation use
only, as described in the accompanying printed license agreement.  If you do
not have a copy of that agreement, contact FirmWorks and we will be pleased
to provide you with one.

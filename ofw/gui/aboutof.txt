		About FirmWorks's Open Firmware

Open Firmware, defined by IEEE Standard 1275-1994, is a processor-independent
open standard for boot firmware.  It includes powerful capabilities for
processor-independent and operating-system-independent booting, auto-
configuration, testing, and debugging.

FirmWorks' implementation of Open Firmware runs on many processors including
PowerPC, X86, SPARC, StrongARM, MIPS, and Alpha.

FirmWorks' implementation is based on field-proven code that has been in
service for many years on millions of computer systems.

This demonstration version of FirmWorks' Open Firmware is licensed for
evaluation use only, as described in the accompanying license agreement.
If you do not have a copy of that agreement, contact FirmWorks and we will
be pleased to provide you with one.

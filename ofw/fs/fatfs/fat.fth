\ File Allocation Table manipulation.

\ For performance, we cache a portion of the FAT (currently 3 sectors).
\ This also makes it easier to extract entries from the FAT, because
\ for floppy disk, FAT entries are 1.5 bytes long, and if we have 3
\ (or multiples of 3) sectors in the cache, then the cache contains
\ an integral number of FAT entries, with no fragments.

\ We keep a separate FAT cache for each device.
\ This improve performance and simplifies the code which deals with
\ flushing the cache, since switching devices does not require a cache
\ flush.  This also helps in supporting devices with sector sizes
\ > 512 bytes, because we can size the FAT cache as a multiple of the
\ device's native sector size.

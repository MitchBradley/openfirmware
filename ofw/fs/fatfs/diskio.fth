\ Implementation of the device driver interface used by the DOS file
\ system code.  This file knows some details of both the underlying
\ device level and the DOS file level above.  It is responsible for
\ translating between those levels; for instance, it translates DOS
\ device numbers to the corresponding SCSI logical unit numbers.
\
\ Exports:
\
\   read-sectors   (S sector# #sectors addr -- error? )   Reads sectors
\   write-sectors  (S sector# #sectors addr -- error? )   Writes sectors
\   r/w-sectors  (S sector# #sectors addr lun read? -- error? )

\ Imports:

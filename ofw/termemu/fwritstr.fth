\ ANSI 3.64 Terminal Emulator.
decimal
headerless
\ ansi-emit is the routine which handles the current character.
\ It is deferred because the terminal emulator can be in one of several
\ states, depending on the previous characters.  For each distinct state,
\ a different routine is installed as the action performed by ansi-emit.
\ The states are:
\
\   alpha-state		This is the "normal" state.  Printable characters
\			are displayed, control characters are interpreted,
\			and the ESCAPE character switches to escape-state .
\
\   escape-state 	In this state, an ESCAPE has been seen and we
\			are expecting a "[" character to switch us to
\			escbrkt-state.  In escape-state, a few control
\			characters are recognized, and apart from that,
\			any non-"[" character switches to alpha-state .
\
\   escbrkt-state	An ESCAPE [  pair has been seen.  We collect numeric
\			arguments until an alphabetic command character
\			is received, then we execute the command and switch
\			to alpha-state .  Command characters are those
\			with ASCII codes numerically greater than or equal
\			to the ASCII code for the "@" character.
\
\   skipping-state	Entered from escbrkt-state if an invalid character
\			is received while waiting for a command character.
\			In skipping state, all non-command characters are
\			ignored, and the next command character switches
\			to alpha-state .

\ This section introduces a new set of words:
\  $case  $of  $endof  $endcase
\ The semantics are very similar to the standard
\ Forth case statement.

\ Example of use:
\ : foo ( $ -- )
\   ( $ ) $case
\      " abc" $of  ." The string starts with abc" $endof
\      " xyz" $of  ." Oh, it's an xyz string"     $endof
\      ( $ ) ." **** It was " 2dup type
\   $endcase

\ The default clause is optional.
\ When an $of clause is executed, the remaining selector string (past
\ the matched string) remains on the string.  It is the user's
\ responsibility to dispose of the string.
\ When a default clause is executed, the entire selector string is
\ on the stack.  The default clause must drop the selector, e.g., 2drop.

\ At run time, ($of) tests the top of the stack against the selector.

\ If the first N characters of the string supplied to $case are
\ the same, the selector string is shortened and the following
\ forth code is executed.  If the first characters are not the
\ same, execution continues at the point just following the
\ the matching $endof

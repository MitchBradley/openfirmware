This directory contains C code that can be compiled into the Forth
wrapper program to provide memory-to-memory data compression using
the ZIP deflate algorithm.

The files in this directory were derived from the source code
for gzip 1.2.4 as follows:

	deflate.c	From gzip deflate.c, essentially verbatim
	trees.c		From gzip trees.c, essentially verbatim
	bits.c		From gzip bits.c, essentially verbatim
	gzip.h		From gzip gzip.h, essentially verbatim

	zipmem.c	From gzip gzip.c and zip.c, but both files
			were gutted and only a small fraction of
			the code was extracted to form zipmem.c.

	util.c		From gzip util.c.  About half or more of the
			file was discarded, and the rest was barely
			touched.

	tailor.h	From gzip tailor.h, but massively gutted,
			leaving only a few defines.

The "essentially verbatim" files, to the extent that they were modified
at all, were modified by commenting-out irrelevant sections of the
files with "#ifdef FWnotdef ... #endif".

A lot of the gzip code is concerned with handling files and their
modes and attributes, command line arguments, decompressing, and
handling multiple compression methods.  The code in this directory
is concerned solely with the problem of compressing from memory to
memory, using only the ZIP "deflate" method.

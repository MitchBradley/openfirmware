\ "resolves" gives a name to the run-time clause specified by the most-
\ recently-defined "does>" or ";code" word.  A number of defining words
\ assume that their appropriate run-time clause will be resolved with a
\ particular word.  For instance, "vocabulary" refers to a run-time clause
\ called <vocabulary>.  When the run-time code for vocabularies is defined
\ in the kernel source, "resolves" is used to associate its address with
\ the name <vocabulary>.  See the kernel source for examples.

\   "Transition" words.  Versions of compiling words which are defined
\ in the host environment but which compile code into the target
\ environment.
\   Once compiling words are redefined, care must be taken to select
\ the old instance of that word for use in other definitions.  For instance,
\ when "if" is redefined, subsequent definitions will frequently want to use
\ the old "if", so the search order must be explicitly controlled in order
\ to access the old one instead of the new one.

\ Transition versions of tick and bracket-tick.  Forward references
\ are not permitted with tick because there is no way to know how

\ forward references depends on the assumption that the forward
\ reference resolves to a compilation address that is compiled into

\ Some debugging words.  Allow the printing of the name of words as they
\ are defined.  threshhold is the number of words that must be defined
\ before any printing starts, and granularity is the interval between
\ words that are printed after the threshhold is crossed.  This is very
\ useful if the metacompiler crashes, because it helps you to locate
\ where the crash occurred.  If needed, start with threshhold = 0 and
\ granularity = 20, then set threshhold to whatever word was printed
\ before the crash and granularity to 1.

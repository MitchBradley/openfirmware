\ Symbol entries in "symbols" vocabulary:

\    The "first-occurrence" field is the head of a linked list
\ its value is a pointer to an occurrence of this word in the
\ target dictionary.  Each node in the list is one 16-bit word.
\ The last node contains 0.  If there are no occurrences, the

\    The "resadd" field contains the compilation address of the
\ word, or 0 if the word hasn't been defined yet.
\    Symbols should probably be "does>" words, but aren't for
\ historical reasons.

\ hide-t temporarily prevents the most-recently-created word from being
\ found.  It is used when creating a colon definition, so that a colon
\ definition may refer to a previous word with the same name as itself,
\ without resulting in recursion.
\
\ reveal-t is the inverse of hide-t, allowing the most-recently-created
\ word to be found again.
\
\ In the normal Forth kernel, hide is implemented by unhooking the most
\ recent word from the dictionary.  That implementation doesn't work in
\ the metacompiler, because due to forward referencing, the current colon
\ definition is not necessarily the most-recently-created symbol.
\ Instead, we use a technique similar to the old FIG-Forth "smudge", where
\ the name is altered to make it unrecognizable.  "Smudge" was a toggle,
\ which suffered from the problem that sometimes "smudge" would inadvertantly
\ be executed one too many times, thus leaving the word hidden when it
\ should have been visible.  To eliminate this, we use separate words
\ hide and reveal.

\ "compile-t takes a string and compiles a reference to that word in the
\ target dictionary.  In the case of a forward reference, this may
\ involve creating an entry in the symbol vocabulary.  Even if the
\ word has already been defined, we don't emplace the compilation address
\ yet.  Instead, we just add this location to a linked list of references
\ to the word.  For what its's worth, this makes generating a
\ cross-reference list easy at the end of the metacompilation.

: $compile-t  ( adr len -- )  $findsymbol ( acf ) addlink  ;

\ compile-t is used inside a definition.  It takes an in-line string
\ argument and stores the string somewhere in the definition.  When the
\ definition executes, that string is $compile-t'd.  This allows
\ immediate words to compile run-time words, even if the run-time
\ word hasn't yet been defined in the target system.

\ example : foo   compile-t bar   ;
\ when foo executes, it will then search for the word bar and
\ compile a reference to it.  The STRING bar is stored within foo

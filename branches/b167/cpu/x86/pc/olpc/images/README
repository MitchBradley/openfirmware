The .565 image format is a very simple format for 16-bit RGB 565 image data.
The reason I invented this new format is because I couldn't find an
existing standard format that handles 565 representation.  There is
something for the iPod, I think, but I couldn't find any tools to
process it.

The file has an 8-byte header and then the data.

Header:
"C565"  - 4 bytes
width   - 2 bytes, little endian
height  - 2 bytes, little endian

Then 2 * width * height bytes of data.
Each pixel is 2 bytes, little endian, in RGB565 format.
Each line is width pixels.

ofw/gui/bmp24rgb565.fth is a program to convert 24-bit RGB .bmp files to this format.

   forth ofw/gui/bmp24rgb565.fth -s "bmp24rgb565  foo.bmp  foo.565"

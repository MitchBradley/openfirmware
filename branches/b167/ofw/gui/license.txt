5.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

liability to Customer, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or
otherwise, exceed the license fee paid by Customer for the Software.  The
foregoing limitations shall apply even if as a result any applicable
warranty fails of its essential purpose.

6.  TERM ANS TERMINATION

    This License is effective until terminated.  Customer may terminate
this License at any time by destroying all copies of the Software (including
any documentation), in any form or storage medium, in its possession.
FirmWorks may terminate this License without cause at any time by notice
to Customer.  This License will terminate immediately without notice from

Upon any termination, Customer must destroy all copies of the Software
(including any documentation), in any form or storage medium, in its
possession.

control laws, including the U.S. Export Administration Act and its

and acknowledges that it has the responsibility to obtain licenses to

8.  U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS

    If Customer is acquiring the Software, including accompanying
documentation, on behalf of the U.S. Government, the following provisions
apply.  The Software is a "commercial item" as that term is defined at 48
C.F.R. 2.101, consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial
computer software documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212.
Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4,

accordance with the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., excluding its
choice of law provisions.

10.  SEVERABILITY

     If any of the above provisions are held to be in violation of
applicable law, void, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, then such
provisions are hereby waived to the extent necessary for the License to be
otherwise enforceable in such jurisdiction.  However, if in FirmWorks's
opinion deletion of any provisions of the License by operation of this
paragraph unreasonably compromises the rights or liabilities of FirmWorks
or its licensors, FirmWorks reserves the right to terminate the License.

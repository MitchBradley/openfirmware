purpose: Generic memory test that FCode drivers may use
copyright: Copyright 1999-2001 Sun Microsystems, Inc.  All Rights Reserved

\ TODO: Make this interruptible

\ Generic memory test module.  This will test pretty much any memory
\ array, given the address, size, and width of the array.
\
\ Variables:
\   mask		Contains a bit mask with ones for each data bit
\			which is implemented in the memory array.  Examples:
\			A 32-bit memory array would use mask = (hex)ffffffff.
\			A 24-bit memory array would use mask = (hex)00ffffff.
\
\   meml@		Defer word which by default executes l@ .  Change this
\			if your memory cannot handle 32-bit operations.
\
\   meml!		Defer word which by default executes l! .  Change this
\			if your memory cannot handle 32-bit operations.
\
\   memw@, memw!, memc@, memc!   Similar to meml@ and meml! but for 16-bit
\			and 8-bit operations.
\
\ Tests:
\
\ mem-addr-test  ( membase memsize -- fail-flag )
\			In the memory array starting at membase, tests
\			the address lines for the following static
\			faults:
\			a) Address line stuck
\			b) Address line shorted to another address line
\			c) Address line shorted to a data line
\
\			This test is quite fast; it's execution time is
\			O(#add-lines).
\
\ mem-data-test  ( membase -- fail-flag )
\			"Walking Ones and Zeroes" data line test.  Tests
\			each data line for static "stuck-at" faults.  The
\			value contained in the "mask" variable controls
\			which data lines are tested.
\
\ mem-size-test  ( membase -- fail-status )
\			Verifies that memory can be accessed either as
\			bytes, shortwords, or longwords.  Writes the
\			hex number 12345678 to the location at membase,
\			one byte at a time.  Then reads it back as a longword
\			and checks the value.  Then does the same thing
\			writing one shortword at a time.
\			The "mask" variable selects which data bits are
\			significant.
\
\ mem-bits-test  ( membase memsize -- status )
\			Within the range membase .. membase+memsize-1, tests
\			each location to ensure that no bits are stuck at
\			either one or zero.  This is done by verifying that the
\			location can contain both the value ffffffff and
\			the value 0.  The "mask" variable selects which data
\			bits are significant.
\
\ address=data-test  ( membase memsize -- fail-flag )
\			Within the range membase .. membase+memsize-1,
\			writes each longword location with it's own address,
\			then verifies.  The "mask" variable selects which
\			data lines are significant during the verify step.
\			This test checks for the uniqueness of individual
\			locations with RAM chips.  "Stuck" address lines
\			external to RAM chips would presumably be detected
\			more quickly by "mem-addr-test".
\
\ mats-test  ( membase memsize pattern -- fail-flag )
\			Within the range membase .. membase+memsize-1, tests
\			groups of 3 consecutive locations.  The first and third
\                       locations in the group are written with "pattern"
\			and the second location is written with the bitwise
\			inverse of "pattern".  Verifies the data bits selected
\			by the "mask" variable.
\			I'm not sure what kind of failures that this test
\			can catch, other than failures that are more easily
\			detected by other tests.
\
\ memory-test-suite  ( membase memsize -- status )
\			Performs a series of tests on the range of memory
\			from membase to membase+memsize-1.

\ "Walking Address Line" test ( quick )

\ The following routine tests an individual address line for the
\ following static faults:
\    a) stuck at either 0 or 1
\    b) shorted to a data line
\    c) shorted to another address line
\ Sets the failed variable if a failure is detected

nuser add-base
nuser add-top
: address-line-test  ( addr# -- )

   failed @ >r

   \ First we write all zeroes to the top and bottom memory locations
   0 add-base @ meml!   0 add-top  @ meml!

   \ Now we write all ones to 2 locations: the location whose address
   \ differs from the bottom address only by the address line under test,
   \ and the location whose address differs from the top address only by
   \ the address line under test.

   1 over <<			( addr# offset )
   add-base @ over +  ffffffff swap meml! \ store ones at "base + [1 << addr#]"
   add-top  @ over -  ffffffff swap meml! \ store ones at "top  - [1 << addr#]"
				( addr# offset )

   \ Now we check to see if either of the top or bottom locations got
   \ clobbered when we wrote the other two locations.  This tests for
   \ address uniqueness in the one address line, and also for that address
   \ line stuck to a data line.

   0  add-base @  mem-test      ( addr# offset )
   0  add-top  @  mem-test      ( addr# offset )

   \ Finally, we do the whole thing again, except that we use the opposite
   \ data values.  This allows us to distinguish a stuck address line
   \ from an address line shorted to a data line.  We don't actually
   \ use this distinction, since the only output from this entire test
   \ is "good" or "bad".

				( addr# offset )
   ffffffff add-base @ meml!	\ store all ones into bottom of memory
   ffffffff add-top  @ meml!	\ store all ones into top of memory

   ffffffff add-base @  mem-test
   ffffffff add-top  @  mem-test
				( addr# offset )

   \ If more detailed failure analysis were desired, we could distinguish
   \ between the various places where the test could fail.
   \ For now, we just return pass or fail.

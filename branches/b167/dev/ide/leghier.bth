purpose: Load file for IDE driver FCode

\ This version of the load file uses the following configuration:
\   IDE controller on PCI bus
\   Supports 4 drives (primary/secondary * master/slave)
\   IDE controller accessed via legacy addresses (ISA I/O ports)
\   DMA support present but disabled (because NT doesn't like it
\      if the IDE controller is in bus-mastering mode when NT starts)
\   Two-level hierarchy, i.e. pci-ide/ide@1/disk@1
\ This is the version that works with the Intel 82371 south bridge

\ To disable DMA, use the following line; do not omit the dmaide.fth
\ file from the load, because it contains not only DMA code but also
\ a workaround for the Winbond chip's PIO bug.
\ With the current HAL, NT seems to be unhappy if the controller is
\ left in bus mastering mode.
